<h1>Shoes</h1>
<p>
As we all know shoes can either break or make an outfit. <br>
That's why is super duper important to make sure that shoes you decide to wear look good and are comfortable to wear.
When I go out I tend to opt for a platform heel as they are more suitable for long wear than stilettos.Occasionally I may find myself wearing a stiletto but I tend to regret it later on in the day!
I would reccomend wearing stilettos to dinner parties,restaurants etc as you won't be standing up for a huges amount of time.</p>
<p>For casualwear I like to wear really simple but nice trainers.This is because I love the cute effortlessness of them.My favourite trainors would be my Nike Huaraches,Nike Cortez and Adidas Superstars.However sometimes wearing these shoes can get a bit boring or monetonous.This is when I would opt for low rise doc martens instead.</p>

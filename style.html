<h1>A night out</h1>
<p>Last week I went out with a group of my friends.
<br>
Sometimes I feel like people expect girls to always wear dresses when they go out but that isn't always the case. When I go out during the winter I like to wear nice jeans or a playsuit because I think its cute and casual and you won't be too cold due to the harsh winter nights.Remember during the colder seasons dress like its your last night out but don't freeze to death!</p>
<p>For this look I decided to wear a black choker top with blue skinny ripped jeans.
I wore black knee-high platform boots and paired it with a black leather jacket.
For my hair I decided to wear it in  loose curls.To achieve this look I left my Bantu Knot-out for 2 days which loosened the curls.</p>
<p>As you can see its not too hard to look good in the cold.Just wear clothes that are true to you and your personality is sure to shine through!</p>

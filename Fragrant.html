<h2>Scents</h2>
<p>
A really good perfume often makes me feel amazing and like I can conquer the world! <br>
Finding the right perfume that's perfect for you is easy if you have an idea of what type of signature smell you tend to go for.I myself know that I quite like sweet,floral and citrus scents so those are the types of scents that I usually buy.
</p>
At the moment I've been wearing the following perfumes:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.boots.ie/ted-baker-london-porcelain-roses-body-spray-collection-10232687">
Ted Baker London Body Spray</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.molloyspharmacy.com/victoria-secret-coconut-passion-fragrance-mist-250ml.html">
            Victoria's Secret Coconut Passion
        </a>
    </li>

    <li>
        <a href="http://www.theperfumeshop.com/ie/Marc-Jacobs/Dot/Eau-de-Parfum-for-her/p/26290EDPJU">
            Marc Jacobs Dot Eau de Parfum
        </a>
    </li>

    <li>
        <a href="https://www.perfume-click.ie/So...-Eternal-Eau-de-Toilette-30ml-Spray-s13044/">
            So...? Eternal Eau de Toilette
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>A perfume that I would really like to try would be the Melanie Martinez Crybaby Milk but unfortunately it's sold out everywhere.I will admit that the sole reason I want it is because of it's unique packaging and the fact that the actual perfume liquid itself is cloudy and milky and looks like real milk!Hopefully I'll get it soon and when I do I'll be sure to blog about it.</p>
